= Spring Security

Spring Security is a framework that provides xref:features/authentication/index.adoc[authentication], xref:features/authorization/index.adoc[authorization], and xref:features/exploits/index.adoc[protection against common attacks].
With first class support for securing both xref:servlet/index.adoc[imperative] and xref:reactive/index.adoc[reactive] applications, it is the de-facto standard for securing Spring-based applications.
